General TODO list:

Not done:
 - Remote REHASH authorized by IsOperRemote() locally, shared block on target server


The Auditorium mode mod:

Done:
 - Dealing with JOIN
 - Dealing with SJOIN
 - Dealing with PART
 - Disallow non-v/h/o users from sending privmsgs or notices to +a channels
 - Dealing with OPME
 - Dealing with opping, deopping, halfopping, dehalfopping, voicing, and devoicing on +a channels
   - Non-o/v/h's will need to see new o/h/v users join, and part when o/v/h is removed  
   - New o/v/h users will need to get a JOIN burst as well
   - Finally, anyone losing o/v/h will need to be seen PART'ing by other non-o/v/h users
 - Make sure to send only the right NAMES and such when a user JOIN's an auditorium
 - Update WHO for channel queries to send the proper data same as NAMES

Not done:
 - Update KICK to send to the right people
 - Figure out how to address servers that don't understand +a (maybe a patch to make them set +m ?)
 - OPME must result in newly-opped oper being sent JOIN burst for the channel
