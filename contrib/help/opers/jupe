JUPE [servername] :[reason]

The JUPE command takes two arguments. The first argument is the server
you wish to jupe (ban) and the second argument is the reason for the
jupe. Please be aware that the use of this command can be highly dangerous
and can be used to jupe your own servers if you're not careful.
