IRCASC IRCD (based on ircd-hybrid)

This is the IRC server used by IRCASC.  It is hybrid compatible but offers some local advancements
that we believe are of value to server administrators including user privacy enhancements,
a modified /opme command, AES cipher support for SSL/TLS connections, a default nicklen of 16, etc.
